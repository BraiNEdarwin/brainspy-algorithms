This package has been created and it is maintained by the [Brains](https://www.utwente.nl/en/brains/) team of the [NanoElectronics](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/ne/) research group at the University of Twente. It has been designed and developed by:
-   **Unai Alegre-Ibarra**, [@ualegre](https://github.com/ualegre) ([u.alegre@utwente.nl](mailto:u.alegre@utwente.nl))
-   **Hans Christian Ruiz-Euler**, [@hcruiz](https://github.com/hcruiz) ([h.ruiz@utwente.nl](mailto:h.ruiz@utwente.nl))

With the contribution of:
-  **Bram van de Ven**, [@bbroo1](https://github.com/bbroo1) ([b.vandeven@utwente.nl](mailto:b.vandeven@utwente.nl)) : General improvements and testing of the different hardware drivers and devices.
- **Michel P. de Jong** [@xX-Michel-Xx](https://github.com/xX-Michel-Xx) ([m.p.dejong@utwente.nl](mailto:m.p.dejong@utwente.nl)): Testing of the package and identification of bugs.
 - **Michelangelo Barocci** [@micbar-21](https://github.com/micbar-21/).  The usage of multiple DNPUs simultaneously and the creation of an improved PCB for measuring DNPUs.
 - **Jochem Wildeboer** [@jtwild](https://github.com/jtwild/)  Nearest neighbour loss functions.
 - **Annefleur Uitzetter**: The genetic algorithm from SkyNEt.

Some of the code present in this project has been refactored from the [skynet](https://github.com/BraiNEdarwin/SkyNEt) legacy project. The original contributions to the scripts, which are the base of this project, can be found at skynet, and the authorship remains of those people who collaborated in it. Using existing scripts from skynet, a whole new structure has been designed and developed to be used as a general purpose python library.
